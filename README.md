# Insurance-Cost-Prediction
**Business Problem:** An insurance company wants to automate the process of charging the patients with insurance amount based on their demographic, behavioral and region data.
**Objective:** To predict the insurance charges the patient has to pay based on their age, sex, number of children they have, whether they smoke or not and the region where they live.
**Approach:** Performed EDA uncovering the relationship between different variables. Found which variables are most correlated with the target variable i.e. charges. Fit Linear Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest models to the data to choose the best performing model. Used GridSearchCV to select the best parameters for Random Forest Regressor.
